# Webgui

This package is a GUI that displays all diagonostic and camera data in our system via local server that can be accessed using a router teathered to the jetson. It would be sweet if we had wireless everywhere so we could make this truly remote, alas we must settle for local instead.

This package is the one used on polaris, but I would like it to be redone using better GUI tools instead of HTML, such as python, C++/C#, ruby, etc. I want it to look prettier and function better ( basically give it a more professional look).

The way the system is designed now is fundamentally different then polaris, but not in a worse way. Since this is not part of the main system per say, I will allow the designer to bypass the "Sailorman" in the devices package and read directly from the peripherals class.  

Good luck. Remember to have fun with it.
