<!--
    This launch file tests the monitor package by creating 1 test node to spam
    the bus. These nodes represent devices on the physical can 
    bus (such as powerboard and hydrophones) and replicate their behaviour.

    Specifically, A test node will send the protocol_MID_PB_DeviceName message. I expect monitor to publish
    it to its topic and the device package to set the device as "active" within the 
    peripheral class. I will confirm it is active by looking at the rqt_console

    Packages being tested:
        Monitor
        Devices
    Nodes being tested:
        Monitor/HardwareToSoftware_node
        Devices/Powerboard_node
    Test nodes:
        auvic_rostesting/powerboardSimulator

    NOTE: for this test to work. the virtual can has to be setup. Do this by going into /software/wiki/configuration/debug_CAN
            and running the setup interface bash script. Call it 'vcan0' or it wont work. The can-utils interface needs to be 
            reconfigured each time your computer is powered off.
