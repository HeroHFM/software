If the package does not have message_generation or message_runtime at the time of creation, alot of errors will occur when it comes time to create messages and services. I spent many hours searching the internet and having them give me the same explation with no change in my situation so Ill give it to you straght. If for whatever reason your messages/servcies arent being generated by catkin_make (you can check this by looking into /devel/include/<package> and seeing your message files), you need to remove all instances where your messages are being called in the ENTIRE system, then remove /devel and  /build, then run catkin_make --force-cmake. All instances of the messages need to be removed because it seems messages are compiled after the executable nodes, ergo an error is thrown for a message that isnt even compiled yet. But this is only an issue if message_generation and message_runtime arent included in the catkin_create_pkg command.

Moral of the story: dont forget to include message_generation in catkin_create_pkg.
